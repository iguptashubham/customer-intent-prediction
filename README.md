# Customer-intent-prediction
Logistic regression is a binary classification technique used to predict outcomes like customer churn or purchase intent. It models the probability of an event happening (e.g., a customer making a purchase) based on input features.

# Pipeline of Model

Certainly! Let's delve into the model pipeline I created. This pipeline combines several essential steps to build a predictive model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The pipeline begins by handling raw data. It performs transformations to make the data suitable for modeling.
   - Specifically, it:
     - **One-Hot Encodes** categorical features (like product category and brand) to convert them into numerical representations.
     - **Standardizes** numerical features (such as customer age, purchase frequency, and satisfaction) to have zero mean and unit variance.
     - Applies a **Power Transformation** (Box-Cox) to the product price feature to improve its distribution.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - After preprocessing, the pipeline feeds the transformed data into a **Logistic Regression** model.
   - Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an event (e.g., customer making a purchase).
   - The model learns from historical data to make predictions based on the input features.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Although not explicitly mentioned, hyperparameters (like solver, maximum iterations, and regularization) can be fine-tuned to optimize model performance.
   - The choice of hyperparameters affects the model's accuracy and generalization ability.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - It's crucial to assess how well the model performs. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score help evaluate its effectiveness.
   - Iteratively refine the model based on evaluation results.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in real-world scenarios (e.g., an application or website).
   - Continuously monitor and maintain the model as new data becomes available.

In summary, this pipeline transforms data, trains a logistic regression model, and prepares it for practical use. ðŸš€
